It all started on June 16th 2011 with a blog post:

That's right! June 16th this year, 2021, marks our 10th birthday! ðŸ¥³

To celebrate we want to give something special back to the security research community, and we chose to giveaway a fully paid [Pentesting with Kali Offensive Security PEN-200 OSCP certification course](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), worth $999!

To be in with a chance to win the best hands on security certification available, all you have to do is submit a valid WordPress core, plugin or theme vulnerability to us via [our website submission form](https://wpscan.com/submit).

We will be picking a winner at random on our birthday, June 16th, from any security researcher that submitted a valid vulnerability to us this year (2021) up until our birthday.

Best of luck to you and thank you for your support over the years!
