## The vulnerabilities

WordPress 5.2.2 was released on October 30th 2020, reportedly fixing 10 security vulnerabilities. Below are the vulnerabilities that were mentioned in the [release notes](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/10/wordpress-5-5-2-security-and-maintenance-release/) and that have been added to the [WPScan](https://wpscan.com) WordPress Vulnerability Database so far, including one from our very own security researcher, Erwan:

- [Props to Alex Concha of the WordPress Security Team for their work in hardening deserialization requests.](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10446)

- [Props to David Binovec on a fix to disable spam embeds from disabled sites on a multisite network.](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10447)

- [Thanks to Marc Montas from Sucuri for reporting an issue that could lead to XSS from global variables.](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10448)

More details will be added to the security issues in the database as they come to light.

## WordPress < 5.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Theme Background

Erwan, a security researcher from the [WPScan](https://wpscan.com) team, discovered and responsibly disclosed a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to change the background image of the theme. For a successful attack, a privileged authenticated WordPress user would need to visit a page the attack controls, for the CSRF attack to be executed.

Full technical details will be released in the near future.

Erwan responsibly disclosed the CSRF issue to WordPress via their [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/wordpress) around 5 months ago (May 24th 2020). He discovered the issue while developing an internal tool to help us discover authorisation and CSRF issues in WordPress plugins during security assessments. Since discovering the issue, we kept the details strictly between ourselves and WordPress.

We only noticed that the issue had been patched when we were going through the commit logs of the [WordPress 5.2.2 Security Release](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/10/wordpress-5-5-2-security-and-maintenance-release/).

This is the third time a WPScan team member has reported a security issue, or assisted in a security release. Ryan helped review a security patch for an SSRF vulnerability fixed in [version 3.5.1](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/), and also helped analysing and reporting a [Failure to Restrict URL Access](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/6015) vulnerability in WordPress version 2.9.

Unfortunately, we found the process of reporting a security issue to WordPress disappointing. Although the HackerOne platform made it easy to initially report the security issue to WordPress, we were soon left in the dark as to when it would be fixed. We only found out that it had been fixed after the release, by looking through the commit logs, 5 months after reporting the issue. As of writing the HackerOne report has still not been updated to reflect that it has been patched. Communication between the researcher and WordPress could be greatly improved. That being said, Erwan was awarded a bounty of $350 only a few days after reporting the issue.
