## WordPress Security Scan

WordPress is undisputedly the most popular Content Management System (CMS) in use today. With the most commonly quoted figure being the one published by w3techs, putting WordPress at [37.7% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) today (July 2020) and growing. It is no surprise then that WordPress is also the most targeted CMS by hackers.

Despite what some believe, WordPress is a secure CMS, depending on what your definition of "secure" is.

WordPress has been around since [May 27th, 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Release_history), with the release of WordPress 0.7. That means that WordPress has been around for 17 years and has changed a lot in that time. Today, WordPress Core is a mature project, but that doesn't mean that it still does not, or will not in the future, suffer from security vulnerabilities. No software can ever be 100% secure.

The main problem with WordPress when it comes to security is its third-party plugins. These plugins can be developed by anyone with varying degrees of security experience and uploaded to the official WordPress plugin repository. The plugins are verified by a team at WordPress when initially uploaded, but it is not known to what extent the plugins are checked for security issues. And once the plugin has been approved, the developer is free to make any future changes without any verifications. This can lead to developers introducing security vulnerabilities later on in subsequent updates to the plugin.

According to [Sucuri's 2019 Website Threat Research Report](https://sucuri.net/reports/2019-hacked-website-report/) they found that "44% of all vulnerable websites had more than one vulnerable software present in the environment".

Here at WPScan, we can offer many different solutions to this problem. To help you reduce the risk of your WordPress website being hacked by an outdated and vulnerable version of WordPress, plugin vulnerabilities, or theme vulnerabilities.
