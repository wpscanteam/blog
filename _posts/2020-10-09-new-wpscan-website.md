## WPScan WordPress Vulnerability Database

After several months work we have launched our brand new website for the [WPScan WordPress Vulnerability Database](https://wpscan.com/):

The new website was designed by the awesome folks over at [Hype4](https://hype4.com/), and we would highly recommend them!

If you haven't already noticed, we have also changed our domain name from wpvulndb.com to [wpscan.com](https://wpscan.com/). We thought that wpvulndb.com was hard to say and even harder to remember, we hope that wpscan.com solves those problems.

Over the next few months we will be collecting user feedback and will then do a second round of changes on the website, so if you have any feedback, please [get in touch](https://wpscan.com/contact).

We [launched](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/111) the WPScan WordPress Vulnerability Database in 2014 after about 9 months of work, thanks to a grant from a Belgium security conference, [BruCON](https://www.brucon.org/).

In case you have already forgotten what it looked like:

We hope that the new website design makes it a better experience to use for our users and looks more professional.

Feel free to [Tweet](https://twitter.com/_wpscan_) any feedback to us!
