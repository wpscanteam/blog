## New WPVulnDB Features

For the past few weeks we have been busy working on new features and improvements to our [WordPress Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com/), which went live today.

Even though the whole world is going through difficult times right now, we are still here adding vulnerabilities to our databases and improving our services.

So, what do we have for you!

## 1. Choose what you want to be alerted on

You are now able to choose what you want to receive email alerts on. You can choose everything, which is the default, or, you can choose just plugins if you like, or even choose which individual plugins you want to alerted on.

You can configure this via your profile page, and it looks like this:

## 2. Webhooks when vulnerabilities are updated

We introduced [Webhooks](https://blog.wpscan.org/wpvulndb/2019/12/09/wpvulndb-webhooks.html) and [Slack incoming Webhooks](https://blog.wpscan.org/wpvulndb/2020/03/16/slack-incoming-webhook-notifications.html) over the past few months. These will send a Webhook when a new vulnerability is added to the database. The new functionality now lets you also be alerted when vulnerabilities are updated.

You can configure this via your profile page, and it looks like this:

## 3. Billing details

You can now add billing details on registration or within your profile page, which will be displayed on all future invoices.

You can configure this via your profile page, and it looks like this:

There have been many other enhancements on the backend as we continue work to build a great service for our users.

We hope that everyone keeps safe out there and we also welcome any feedback.
