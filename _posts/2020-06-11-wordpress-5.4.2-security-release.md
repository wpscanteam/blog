## WordPress 5.4.2 Security and Maintenance Release

Yesterday, June 10th, [WordPress released version 5.4.2](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/06/wordpress-5-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/), which was a security and maintenance release.

Version 5.4.2 of WordPress fixes 6 separate security issues. Three of which addressed authenticated [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). One addressing an potential [Open Redirect vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00500100_open-redirection-reflected). One privilege escalation vulnerability, and one issue where password protected posts and pages comments could be exposed in certain circumstances.

As well as the 5.4.2 minor version release, WordPress also released security fix for WordPress versions as far back as WordPress version 3.7, which was [released in 2013](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-3-7/).

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Authenticated XSS via Media Files

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Open Redirection

This issue was found by Ben Bidner of the WordPress Security Team. The security issue affected the `wp_validate_redirect()` function. An Open Redirect vulnerability usually allows attackers to redirect unsuspecting users to malicious websites. The patch for this security issue can be found [here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/10e2a50c523cf0b9785555a688d7d36a40fbeccf).

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Authenticated XSS via Theme Upload

This issue was reported to WordPress by Nrimo Ing Pandum, and he found an authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the theme upload functionality. We assume that this requires the [install_themes](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#install_themes) capability, which only administrator users have.

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Misuse of set-screen-option Leading to Privilege Escalation

This security issue was identified by [Simon Scannell](https://twitter.com/scannell_simon) of RIPS Technologies. Simon is a prolific security researcher who has identified many security issues affecting WordPress in the past. Simon reported a security issue in the `set_screen_options()` function that could allow for Privilege Escalation. The full patch can be found [here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/dda0ccdd18f6532481406cabede19ae2ed1f575d).

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Disclosure of Password-Protected Page/Post Comments

This issue affected the `comment_excerpt()` function, and the full patch can be found [here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/c075eec24f2f3214ab0d0fb0120a23082e6b1122).

## WordPress < 5.4.2 - Authenticated XSS in Block Editor

Sam Thomas (jazzy2fives) reported an issue to WordPress that affected the Block Editor, where low privileged users could inject malicious JavaScript to posts. WordPress does allow some users to inject JavaScript who have the [unfiltered_html](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#unfiltered_html) capability, which are Administrators and Editors. In this case, the user required to exploit this issue must have been Author or less.
